I am a 3rd year Life Science student at HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht. In the past half year I’ve followed a DataScience minor provided by the HU. This Github page serves as my DataScience portofolio for showing off my DataScience skills. The course is created by @amdhaanTlscdsfb26v20Workflows2021 based on the “bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown” book from @xieBookdownAuthoringBooks.

I tend to be very passionate about my study and love to talk about topics surrounding Life Sciences. As of writing this résumé I live with my parents, sister and our dog “Saartje” (breed: markiesje). In my free time my biggest hobby is music. I produce music from time to time and play piano almost daily. Besides music I also like to spent time with friends in the weekends and cycle so now and then. 3.0.2 My education 3.0.3 My most relevant skills related to DataScience (alphabetical order) Assembly tools I’ve worked with the assembly tools Unicycler, PlasmidEC and Gplas. These tools I’ve used within a project where we (our project group) assembled plasmids from bacterial illumina NGS data. This project was commissioned by the RIVM. Bash I’m capable of writing in Bash Cell biology I’ve theoretical knowledge about the principles of the cell such as cell metabolism and cellular communication Cell culture I’m capable of working and running experiments with cell cultures Git/Github I’ve worked with git/github workflows Immunology I’ve theoretical knowledge about the principles regarding immunology Metagenomics I’m capable of writing a pipeline for downstream metagenomics data NGS I’ve theoretical knowledge about the NGS principles of Pac-bio, Illumina and Nanopore Oncology I’ve theoretical knowledge about the hallmarks of tumorcells PCR I’m experienced with PCR both practicly and theoreticly Reproducibility I’m experienced regarding reproducible research R I’m capable of writing in R and experienced with rmarkdown. See my DataScience portofolio RNA/DNA isolation I’m capable of isolating RNA/DNA (including creating a cDNA bank) RNA-seq I’m capable of writing a pipeline for downstream rna-seq analysis using DESeq2 (with results such as heatmaps, count plots, volcano plots, up/downregulated genes Statistics I’m capable of parametric and non-parametric tests and writing a conclusion based on the results 3.0.4 Contact info phone: 0630477492 www: https://thijmenweijgertze.github.io email: thijmen.lifesciences@gmail.com github: https://github.com/ThijmenWeijgertze linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/thijmen-weijgertze-968a5a265/ "],["guerrilla-analytics.html", "4 Guerrilla Analytics", " 4 Guerrilla Analytics 4.0.1 Example Project 4.0.2 Root Of This Bookdown Project ## . ## ├── .gitignore ## ├── 00-METADATA.Rmd ## ├── 01_CV.Rmd ## ├── 02-GuerrillaAnalytics.Rmd ## ├── 03-CElegans.Rmd ## ├── 04-ReproducibleResearch.Rmd ## ├── data ## │ ├── CE-LIQ-FLOW-062_Tidydata.xlsx ## │ └── GuerrillaAnalytics.png ## ├── dataRaw ## │ ├── CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx ## │ └── GuerrillaAnalytics.png ## ├── doc ## │ └── github.placeholder ## ├── LICENSE ## ├── PortofolioBookdown.Rproj ## └── Style.css "],["c.-elegans-plate-experiment.html", "5 C.
