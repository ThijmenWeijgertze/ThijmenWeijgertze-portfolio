I tend to be very passionate about my study and love to talk about topics surrounding Life Sciences. As of writing this résumé I live with my parents, sister and our dog “Saartje” (breed: markiesje). In my free time my biggest hobby is music. I produce music from time to time and play piano almost daily. Besides music I also like to spent time with friends in the weekends and cycle so now and then. My education My most relevant skills related to DataScience (alphabetical order) Assembly tools I’ve worked with the assembly tools Unicycler, PlasmidEC and Gplas.

Open science makes it possible for different research facilities to share their finding with the rest of the world for others to build on. Reproducible research is an important subject within the Open Science. Not only should science publication be available to everyone (after the research has been completed) without any publisher pay wall, but it’s also important that publications are reproducible and the conclusions can be verified. In this chapter I’ll peer review an article from bioRxiv. The article chosen to review is: Exploring Metabolic Anomalies in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19: A Machine Learning Approach with Explainable Artificial Intelligence Criteria The open peer review will use criteria from the following publication: Reproducibility and reporting practices in COVID-19 preprint manuscripts Transparency Criteria Definition Response Type Study Purpose A concise statement in the introduction of the article, often in the last paragraph, that establishes the reason the research was conducted. Also called the study objective. Binary Data Availability Statement A statement, in an individual section offset from the main body of text, that explains how or if one can access a study’s data. The title of the section may vary, but it must explicitly mention data; it is therefore distinct from a supplementary materials section. Binary Data Location Where the article’s data can be accessed, either raw or processed. Found Value Study Location Author has stated in the methods section where the study took place or the data’s country/region of origin. Binary; Found Value Author Review The professionalism of the contact information that the author has provided in the manuscript. Found Value Ethics Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating any ethical concerns, including the presence of sensitive data. Binary Funding Statement A statement within the manuscript indicating whether or not the authors received funding for their research. Binary Code Availability Authors have shared access to the most updated code that they used in their study, including code used for analysis. Binary About the article The research article states in its abstract to have used techniques such as machine learning (ML), explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to analyze metabolic alterations in COVID-19 and Post-COVID-19 patients. The publication aims to uncover metabolic signatures and identify potential biomarkers for these conditions. It states to have analyzed 142 COVID-19, 48 Post-COVID-19 samples and 38 CONTROL patients, with 111 identified metabolites. After which the results have been compared to traditional methods such as PCA and PLS-DA. The comparison showed that the combined techniques of ML, XAI and SHAP outperformed the traditional methods and provides different insights in the metabolic basis of the disease’s progression and its aftermath.

"],["machine-learning.html", "Machine Learning", " Machine Learning Introduction During the “Data Science for biology 2” course every student has the opportunity to learn a new skill for their portfolio. I have decided to introduce myself into “Machine Learning”. I haven chosen machine learning, because over the past decade it has become an important skill in DataScience. Implementing algorithms to predict medical outcomes, using available data sets, can be extremely important for early medical diagnoses. Furthermore machine learning’s high computational power makes it possible to analyze more factors and relations within the data at once. This can be highly beneficial while working with large data sets within the field of Life Sciences. Goal At the end of this course I want to have created an algorithm able to predict the recurrence of breast cancer using the breast-cancer data set. The algorithm will use the R package “tidymodels” for machine learning. Data Credits for the data: &gt; This breast cancer domain was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. Thanks go to M. Zwitter and M. Soklic for providing the data. The table consist of the following variables: Class: no-recurrence-events, recurrence-events age: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90-99. menopause: lt40, ge40, premeno. tumor-size: 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59. inv-nodes: 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, 24-26, 27-29, 30-32, 33-35, 36-39. node-caps: yes, no. deg-malig: 1, 2, 3. breast: left, right. breast-quad: left-up, left-low, right-up, right-low, central. irradiat: yes, no. There are a total of 286 instances from which 201 no-recurrence-events and 85 recurrence-events. Planning I’ll spend 30 hours across 4 days on this skill across 2 weeks Week 1: - Day 1: Delving into the get started guide from tidymodels - Day 2: Delving into the get started guide from tidymodels Week 2: - Day 3: Apply the learned skills on the breast-cancer data set to predict the recurrence of breast cancer. - Day 4: Extension of past days Dataset # loading in data bcData &lt;- read.csv( here::here( &quot;data&quot;, &quot;breast-cancer.data&quot; ), header = FALSE, # dataset does not contain column names col.names = c(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;menopause&quot;, &quot;tumor_size&quot;, &quot;inv_nodes&quot;, &quot;node_caps&quot;, &quot;deg_malig&quot;, &quot;breast&quot;, &quot;breast_quad&quot;, &quot;irradiat&quot;) # setting column names ) # presenting data in table form reactable( bcData, filterable = TRUE, compact = TRUE, bordered = TRUE, defaultPageSize = 5 ) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
